## TODO
## Overall

Look for:
- [ ] Python OOP
- [ ] Project structure


## Pomodoro

- [ ] Add braindump area during work ?or use notion
- [ ] Add a feature to allow you to time yourself instantly for 5 min if you missed break
    - ? go into config page
    - ? type in “I missed my break” to add 5 mins break time to the clock
        - cannot bank or stop the break time, you need a break if you missed, if you typed in the sentence I assume you really missed the break
- [ ] add a restart time logbook
